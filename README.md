# ðŸ¤– Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning ðŸ©º

Predicting diabetes using advanced ML techniques in Python. This project utilizes a dataset of health indicators to build and evaluate predictive models for diabetes risk assessment. ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤“




ðŸš€ Features:

-Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw health data for effective model training.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset to inform feature selection and engineering.

-Model Building: Implement and compare various ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

-Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance for accurate predictions.

-Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
